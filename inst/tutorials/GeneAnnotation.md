# Introduction

Let us suppose we have a set of genes to annotate and we want to use the CoExp Web tool to do that. We are interested in seeing 

* whether there are natural groups of genes wihtin the whole group

* what are these genes doing in relevant conditions for the phenotype we are studying

* what is the predominant cell type, if any, associated to those genes in such phenotype and condition

We will use as an example, the list of monogenic forms of Parkinson from the Genomics England panel App (only the green genes)

First thing we have to do is to choose which are the conditions in which we want to study the genes. So in order to see what is available
