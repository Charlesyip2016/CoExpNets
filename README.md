# CoExpNets brief instructions 

CoExpNets is based on the excellent and widely used WGNCA package, but incorporates a refinement we detail in the following paper <https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0420-6>. It provides ways to create, access and exploit networks based on basic WGCNA features and ideas but we extend them a little bit and make it accessible through a Web interface.

An interesting part of this is that we make available a series of packages like CoExpROSMAP <https://github.com/juanbot/CoExpROSMAP> and CoExpGTEx <https://github.com/juanbot/CoExpGTEx> with already created networks you can use and exploit through the main package, CoExpNets.

## Install the development version from GitHub:

Simply do this
```r
devtools::install_github('juanbot/CoExpNets')
```

And that will be all. More help to come soon.
In the meantime, you can access the tutorials in the package.
